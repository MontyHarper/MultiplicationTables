# Practice Your Multiplication Tables!

I wrote this multiplication game in SwiftUI for iOS 16.0 & up. It should work well on an iPhone or iPad. Download and install using Xcode.

This is my solution to Paul Hudson's [100 Days of SwiftUI Day 35 Challenge](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/guide/ios-swiftui/3/3/challenge).

# How to Play

- Choose multiplication tables to practice by tapping on the colored circles. Each tap will either add the table or subtract it from your list. Colored backgrounds indicate a table has been selected.
- You may include any number of tables from zero to 12 or any one table by itself.
- Select how many questions you want to answer: 5, 10, or 20.
- The setup screen will tell you the time to beat for your selected game. This will either be your current best time or the default of 10 seconds per question.
- Tap "Let's Go!" to start the game.
- Answer each question by tapping the correct answer out of your list of choices.
- The game will let you know if you beat your best time.
- Return to settings to change your tables or number of questions.
- The game automatically saves your best times. It tracks a different best time for each combination of tables + number of quesitons.
